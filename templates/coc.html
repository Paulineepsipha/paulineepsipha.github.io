    <p>
        Our community students aspire to be gentle. This is the leading concept for supervising oneself within community.
    </p>
    <h2>Anticipated Behaviour:</h2>
    <p>
        The following ways of acting are expected and appealed of all community members:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Be friendly and patient
            </li>
            <li>
                Your work will be utilized by other people and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any resolution you take will affect users and co-associate. So be considerate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since our code often rely on the work and help of others, we will be sure to furnish proper attribution. As members of the community, we agree to represent ourselves truthfully, claim only work that is our own, captivate honestly in all
                deeds.

            </li>
            <li>We possibly all experience some annoyance now and then, but we cannot allow
                that annoyance to turn into a personal assault. Not all of us will agree all of the
                time, but the dispute is no excuse for deprived behaviour and deprived manners.
                Be respectful. Treat people the way you want to be treated.
            </li>
            <li>We don't all speak the same speech at the same flair level. Understandable
                communication can help to avoid misinterpretation. Disagreements, social and
                technical, are usual, but we expect participants in the community to settle
                disagreements positively by avoiding: trolling personal attacks monotonous
                arguments.

            </li>
            <li>
                Divergent people have different perspectives on issues. Being incompetent to understand why someone holds a standpoint doesn’t mean that they’re erroneous or wrong. Point of convergence is be helpful and resolve issues and learn from blunder.
